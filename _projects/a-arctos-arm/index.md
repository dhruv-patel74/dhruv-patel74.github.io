# STILL GATHERING PHOTOS AS OF NOW ( linkedin post incoming :D )

## Overview  
This project involved bringing the ARCTOS Studio Robotic Arm kit to life by handling all the physical assembly, electrical integration, and system wiring. I printed the components, assembled the mechanisms, and developed the hardware architecture for a 6-DOF closed-loop robotic arm.


---

## Mechanical Assembly  
- 3D-printed parts as per the ARCTOS kit design using FDM  
- Assembled all six axes and structural components based on provided CAD and manual files

---

## Electronics & Wiring  
- Integrated MKS SERVO57D NEMA17 closed-loop stepper drivers for precise motion control  
- Wired and routed all motor wiring, ensuring a clean and robust connection  
- Integrated diametric magnetic endstops as limit switches for accurate homing and safety  
- Established closed-loop feedback control system, enhancing precision and reliability


---

## Key Learnings & Unique Contributions  
- Learned closed-loop stepper control via MKS SERVO57D, including tuning and calibration techniques  
- Enhanced reliability through the use of magnetic endstops—advantages over mechanical switches in terms of wear and precision  
- Gained experience translating a kit into a fully functional system, including cable management, signal routing, and structural rigidity  
- Developed a deep understanding of how the ARCTOS system’s components (electrical and mechanical) work together for smooth motion

## Future Extensions  
- Add inverse-kinematics control via ROS or simulation tools like RoboDK 
- Implement more robust cable management and modular boards for scalability  
- Explore real-time feedback control improvements and sensor integration (e.g., force sensing)
- Enable computer vision and put the robot on a conveyor belt picking up objects going by
