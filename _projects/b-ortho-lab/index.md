## Overview  
As a researcher at **NovoPedics Orthopedic Laboratory** in New Brunswick, NJ, I focus on developing and testing biocompatible meniscus implants to address orthopedic injuries. My role combined **cell culture techniques**, **biomechanical testing**, and **in vitro experimentation** to evaluate engineered tissues under realistic physiological conditions.

---

## Key Contributions  
- **Plasma Extraction & Scaffold Engineering**  
  Performed plasma extraction from blood samples for use in engineering biocompatible meniscus membranes. 
  Ensured sterility and maintained accurate sample preparation.

- **Biomechanical Testing**  
  Conducted experimental trials measuring stress and strain responses of real and fake meniscus tissue and surrounding ligaments under controlled loads.

## Techniques & Tools  
- **Cell Culture:** Maintaining sterile environments, scaffold preparation, and culture maintenance  
- **Mechanical Testing:** Force-displacement analysis, data interpretation for stress-strain curves  
- **3D Printing (FDM):** Fabrication of testing jigs and holders for experimental setups  
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical evaluation of tissue properties and failure modes

## Challenges & Learnings  
- **Biological Variability:** Developed strategies to minimize error from donor variability in tissue samples  
- **Complex Testing Conditions:** Gained experience creating protocols that mimic physiological environments  
- **Sterile Technique:** Enhanced precision in sample handling and contamination control
